# cobol-check-automation  
Automating COBOL testing with CobolCheck and GitHub Actions  
   
## 🚀 Overview  
This project provides a framework for automating unit and regression tests of COBOL programs using CobolCheck, integrated within a continuous-integration (CI) pipeline via GitHub Actions.  
It is designed to support mainframe and batch-oriented COBOL development workflows, enabling developers to validate logic changes quickly, maintain test coverage, and ensure code quality.  

## 🧰 Features  
- Define test cases for COBOL modules using CobolCheck.  
- Automatically compile, link/edit and execute COBOL test suites when changes are pushed.  
- JCL examples included for scheduling and batch execution.  
- GitHub Actions workflow example to demonstrate CI integration.  
- Clear separation of test harness, production code and JCL jobs.  
- Minimal dependencies and clear structure for easier adoption in mainframe/batch environments.
